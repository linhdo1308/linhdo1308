ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Linh Do.

I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics at the David Eccles School of Business, where I am deepening my expertise in data-driven decision-making, advanced analytics, and machine learning. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from Foreign Trade University in Vietnam, where I developed a strong foundation in business principles and analytics.

I started as a Data Analyst Intern at a telecommunications company. In this role, I utilized R and Excel for exploratory data analysis, data visualization and applied machine learning models to address business challenges. This experience has allowed me to effectively translate data into actionable insights, further enhancing my analytical skill set as I continue to grow in the field of data analytics.
